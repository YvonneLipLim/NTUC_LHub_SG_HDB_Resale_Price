#### Key Insights
- **Price Surge**: 45% overall price growth from 2017-2024, with COVID-19 causing acceleration to 12.7% annual growth in 2021
- **Location Premium**: Central areas command 35-40% higher prices than the national average
- **Lease Impact**: Each additional year of remaining lease adds approximately SGD 7,000 to property values
- **Flat Type Divergence**: Smaller units show more stable appreciation than larger, more volatile units
- **Affordability Challenges**: Only 9.3% of 4-room flats were affordable to median-income earners in 2024
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Machine learning models predict HDB resale prices with 92% accuracy
- **Future Outlook**: Projected 5-7% annual growth through 2026, with variations by town and flat type

#### Methodology
The analysis employed a comprehensive research approach, including:
- Data collection from data.gov.sg (203,412 transaction records)
- Exploratory data analysis revealing key patterns and relationships
- Statistical modeling to quantify relationships between variables
- Time series analysis identifying temporal patterns
- Affordability assessment using established metrics
- Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques

#### Applications
The findings provide actionable insights for:
- Potential Buyers: Strategic location selection, lease-price optimization, timing considerations
- Current Homeowners: Value enhancement strategies, upgrading timing, lease management awareness
- Policymakers: Affordability interventions, non-mature estate enhancement, lease decay management

#### Future Work
Future research opportunities include:
- Enhanced data integration with property listings and neighborhood amenities
- Advanced analytical approaches, including deep learning and spatial econometrics
- Expanded research questions around lease decay valuation and intergenerational housing patterns
- Methodological improvements through model refinement and validation approaches
